# First response after running server:
    # Page not found (404)
    # Request Method:	GET
    # Request URL:	http://127.0.0.1:8000/cars
    # Using the URLconf defined in car_project.urls, Django tried these URL patterns, in this order:

    # admin/
    # The current path, cars, didn’t match any of these.

    # You’re seeing this error because you have DEBUG = True in your Django settings file. Change that to False, and Django will display a standard 404 page.

        # REASON FOR THIS ---> cars app and car_project both have urls.py files TO FIX ---> Register our cars urls.py file with our project urls.py file
            #
